# UBB-SE-2024-921-2
Celebration of Capitalism x Spartacus for Assignment 6

As of 22/05: taken the most recent Spartacus branch and merged their project to ours via another executable that starts our project's executables when the team's button is pressed. ALL 4 PROJECTS NEED TO BE BUILT BEFORE RUNNING THE ENTRYPOINT, SINCE THERE'LL BE NO EXECUTABLES INSIDE THE DEBUG FOLDER.

! TO BUILD DATABASE: in server, modify the connection string under AppSettings.json to suit your PC, then: View > Other Windows > Package Manager Console, type "UPDATE DATABASE"
! TO RUN SERVER: run under https, if it complains, run under http, if it complains again, install Firefox.
